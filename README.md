# Reverse Scroll Direction - Raycast Script Command

_A simple script command for [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) that changes the scroll direction in System Settings using AppleScript._

I use natural scrolling for trackpad and classic scrolling for mouse. Apple only allows one setting for both devices. Rather than running a third-party scroll reverser app to give me independent settings, I run this simple AppleScript from Raycast to toggle scroll modes.

We can only hope that [submitting feedback to Apple](https://www.apple.com/feedback/) will make them rethink this limitation.

## Install

Download `reverse-scroll-direction.applescript`.

Move it to your Raycast script directory.
